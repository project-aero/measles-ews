\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Accuracy of the fitted \emph {SEIR} models and estimated seasonality. (\emph {a}) Comparison of in-sample model predictions and observations for each city. Expected cases are one-week-ahead predictions from the fitted models. The dashed line shows 1:1. Coefficients of determination (\(R^2\)) were calculated as the reduction in the sum-of-squared errors from model predictions relative to a null model of the mean number of cases (Methods). (\emph {b}) The estimated seasonality of the basic reproductive ratio (\(\mathcal {R}_0\)) for each city. \(\mathcal {R}_0\) was approximated as: \(\frac {\eta \beta _t}{(\eta +\nu )(\gamma +\nu )}\), where \(1/\eta \) is the incubation period, \(1/\gamma \) is the infectious period, \(\beta _t\) is the time-specific rate of transmission, and \(\nu \) is the death rate. Only \(\beta _t\) is estimated by our model. We set \(1/\eta \) = 8 days, \(1/\gamma \) = 5 days, and \(\nu \) = 0.05 for calculating \(\mathcal {R}_0\) as shown in this figure. The white line is \(\mathcal {R}_0\) calculated using the MLE parameters; shaded regions are the bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals. The dashed horizontal lines show the common range of measles \(\mathcal {R}_0\): 12 to 18.}}{21}{figure.2}%
