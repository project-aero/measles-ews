# Motivation
Parametric models of disease dynamics are data hungry and take a lot of time and effort to fit.
However, their mechanistic basis may lead to better predictions of outbreaks in highly seasonal systems.
Model-independent early warning signals (EWS), on the other hand, lack mechanism but are easy to calculate and require less data.
An open question is whether parametric models are worth the effort.
That is, are EWS just as good for half the hassle?

In this notebook, I answer the above question by predicting large vs. small outbreaks from a fitted parametric *SEIR* model and from EWS.

# Methods

## Defining large and small outbreaks
The first step is to classify the seasonal epidemics as outbreaks and non-outbreaks.
To do this, I will fit a general mixture model of two exponentials.
The break point between the two defines the incidence at which we classify an outbreak as large or small.
I use incidence, rather than raw case numbers, so I can combine the data from all the cities, increasing the sample size to a decent level.

```{r classify-outbreaks}
# Load measles data
fname <- "../../data/clean-data/weekly-measles-incidence-niger-cities-clean.RDS"
measles_data <- readRDS(fname) %>%
  filter(year > 1994)  # remove 1994 year, only used for modeling

# Make population df
pop_data <- tibble(
  region = c("Agadez (City)", "Maradi (City)", 
             "Niamey (City)", "Zinder (City)"),
  pop = c(118224, 267249, 1027000, 322935)  # from Wikipedia
)

# Summarize to cumulative yearly cases
cusum_data <- measles_data %>%
  group_by(region, year) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  left_join(pop_data, by = "region") %>%  # add in population data
  mutate(incidence = cases/pop)  # calculate incidence

x <- sort(cusum_data$incidence)  # extract incidence data

# Fit null distribution for starting values
fit1 <- MASS::fitdistr(x, "exponential")

# Define likelihood of mixed exponential
mixexplik <- function(p, lambda1, lambda2) {
  z <- p*dexp(x,lambda1) + (1-p)*dexp(x,lambda2)
  return(-sum(log(z)))
}

# Fit the model
mle_fit <- suppressWarnings(  # ignore warnings about bad guesses
  stats4::mle(minuslogl = mixexplik, 
              start= list(p = 0.2,
                          lambda1 = as.numeric(fit1$estimate), 
                          lambda2 = as.numeric(fit1$estimate)), 
              method="Nelder-Mead")
)

# Calculate the boundary incidence between small and large outbreaks
boundary <- qexp(p = 0.5, rate = mle_fit@coef["p"]*mle_fit@coef["lambda1"])
```

The GMM suggests that the boundary between small and large outbreaks is an incidence level of ```r round(boundary, 4)```.

## Simulate a new series
The next step is to simulate a new time series from the fitted models.
I do this because we want to predict outbreaks as if we are dealing with new data, not the same exact data used to fit the model.
For now, I am just going to focus on Niamey as a test case.

```{r sim-new-data}
# Load pomp object
pomp_object <- readRDS("../../code/measles-pomp-object-Niamey.RDS")

# Load MLEs
mle_file <- paste0("../../results/initial-mif-lls-Niamey.csv")
mles <- read.csv(mle_file) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  filter(loglik == max(loglik, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  dplyr::select(-do_grid, -loglik, -loglik_se)

sim <- as_tibble(
    simulate(pomp_object, params = mles, nsim = 1, as.data.frame = TRUE,
             include.data = FALSE, seed = 12345872)
  ) %>%
  filter(time >= 1995) %>%
  dplyr::select(sim, time, reports, S, E, I, RE_seas) %>%
  mutate(year = trunc(time)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_cases = sum(reports)) %>%
  mutate(incidence = cumulative_cases/1027000) %>%  # divide cases by population
  mutate(outbreak_year = ifelse(incidence < boundary, FALSE, TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(date = unique(measles_data$date))

ggplot(sim, aes(x = date, y = reports)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = year, color = outbreak_year)) +
  ggtitle("Simulated time series from the MLE model")
```

## Predict trajectories of the new series
Now we can use the fitted model to predict trajectories, informed by data, via particle filtering.
The idea is to use particle filtering up to a certain time point *t* and then make forecasts for $t + 1, t + 2, t + 3, \dots, t + T$, where *T* is the final week we wish to forecast.
To start, *t* will be the end of the year and *T* will be the end of the next year.
Eventually we will look across forecasts that start from $t-0, t-1, t-2, t-3, \dots, t-k$, where *k* is a week very close to the end of the previous year's measles season (around calendar week 40).

As an initial attempt, I will focus on the large outbreak in 2000 of the simulated series.
The "data" will be reports from week 40 to week 52 in 1999.
Forecasts will be made for all of 2000 (52 weeks).

```{r plot-data-used}
test_data <- sim %>%
  filter(year(date) < 2001) %>%
  filter(year(date) == 2000 | (year(date) == 1999 & week(date) > 40)) %>%
  mutate(split = ifelse(year(date) == 1999, 
                        "initial conditions", 
                        "to be forecast"))

ggplot(test_data, aes(x = date, y = reports)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = split)) +
  ggtitle("Data for initial conditions and to be forecast")
```

For this initial test, I'm going to use the data in red above as known initial conditions for the forecasts from the parametric model.
In practice, I think I should use a particle filter to get the initial states up to a certain point and then forecast from those filtering distributions.
Essentially, I am removing initial conditions error for now.

First, make a `pomp` model that can take a set of initial conditions and then simulate forward.

make_pomp_simulator <- function(do_city, mles, years_to_sim = 1, init)
