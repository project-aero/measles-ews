# measles-ews-MASTER.R
#  Master script documenting the workflow for the measles-ews project.
#  Individual R scripts are sourced in the order necessary to reproduce our
#  results. Note that some scripts are designed to run on a High Performance
#  Computing system. For those scripts, the results are simply read in rather
#  than the code being run.
